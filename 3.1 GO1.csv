"Reviewed in Canada on August 19, 2020","Jason R.","-","yes","Nice design, good clear video quality, motion detection is a little weird.","The design of this camera is actually really nice, it looks almost (but not quite) up to the design and quality standards of something from Nest.  It doesn't look (or feel) like a cheap camera.  It comes with everything you need to get started, a 32GB ""Sandisk"" Micro SD card and a decent quality mount.  I put ""Sandisk"" in quotes because I'm not convinced that it's an authentic Sandisk memory card, but that being said, it seems to work fine and speeds test out OK on it.Setup of the camera confused me a bit at first... what got me was that it wasn't clear that the red LED light on the side of the camera that lights up when you plug it in to charge is actually a button you need to hold down to ""turn it on"".  The manual just says plug it in to turn it on, and doesn't mention that you need to hold this button (which just looks like an LED and not a button at all) down.  I also made the mistake at first of just choosing camera as the device type in the Arenti app, when there is a ""battery camera"" option further down which gives you more appropriate setup instructions for this model.  After figuring that part out, it was pretty smooth sailing... enter the wifi network you want it to connect to, hold a reset button down a bit to get the ""button"" flashing and then you literally just scan a QR code that the app generates on your phone screen by showing it to the camera.  It was easy and went smoothly.The camera can only connect to 2.4Ghz, which is always a bummer this day in age.  Technically, in Canada, we're not allowed to use 5ghz outdoors anyway so this isn't a big loss if you're the type of person that always wants to play by the rules but this is worth mentioning if you know you have a lot of 2.4Ghz pollution where you want to use it.  Charging the internal battery takes quite a long time, hours and hours, even using a really good USB charger (no charger is included in the box, you'll have to reuse one you already own or plug into a PC etc.).The app is fairly nicely designed and easy and intuitive enough to use.  There are a few quirks here and there but overall I think the app is on the better side of how bad these apps can be from relatively unknown brands like this.  Video quality when viewing through the app is pretty darn good for a camera of this price, I really don't have any complaints about the clarity - and the field of view is nice and wide as well which is useful for a camera meant for security.  Common things are all covered like setting notification schedules, motion sensitivity, clip length etc.  When the camera senses motion it will save a clip of fixed specified length to the SD card in the camera (and also upload to cloud, if you sign up for that service, which is not free after 3 months).  You can access the saved clips on the SD card directly from inside the camera using the app, you won't have to pull the SD card out to review footage.The motion detection works OK, mostly, but a couple times I thought there should have been an event and I couldn't find one.  I do have it set to low sensitivity though, because I want to avoid taking too many unnecessary clips filling up the onboard memory and wearing the battery down too fast.  The camera is basically ""sleeping"" until it sees motion, and then only wakes up long enough to record a clip, so the battery does seem to go a long way.  There is no option for continuous recording with this camera, but you can view live footage any time through the app on demand.","4","-","-","-","B07WTK627L","Size: One Pack with SD Card"

"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020","John Elliott","-","-","Great lower cost Arlo Competitor","All the battery operated cameras out there are just crazy expensive at this moment. Dropping a months worth salary like you're buying an engagement ring is not fun for some small wireless cameras. Thankfully today their are options.Enter the arlo competitor ""Arneti"" For the most part is works exactly the same, it has a large internal battery that you charge via a Mini-USB port and than mount on the stand and you're good to go. There is also a place for a Mini-SD card for recordings and they do offer a cloud based service to back stuff up to.The application itself is well made and just a bit behind arlo's finesse, but its darn close. Its easy to follow along and setup. You can get alerts on it and have a 2 way conversation as well. The unit itself is hefty in the hands and well made. It also screws into the base, unlike the arlo which magnetically connects. Which is a pain as where I live it gets windy and thats enough to push it around and bring it out of alignment. Ive also heard that the arlo is incredibly easy to steal. Someone need only walk up to it and grab it. As it has no mounts or wires, the would be thief just scored a multi-hundred dollar camera! I like that the arneti actually screws in which gives it a lot more support and prevents those criminals from taking it. Which is doubly important if you are only using the local DVR function as at that point they have the recording as well!Here are some pros and consPros:-Well made with quality feel and a certain weight to it-Easy mount options with the unit screwing into the base-Great motion detection and messaging to your phone-Good 2 way communication with clear sound-Incredible battery lifeCons-Picture life is good, but could be better-Night viewing is usable but could use more IR lights-Need strong and fast wifiAll in all this is a great competitor to arlo as well as other wireless cameras. You have to set realistic expectations though, this is not going to be a wired camera with 50 IR lights. Its battery operated and has to conserve battery life at the cost of picture quality and night vision.If you are looking for a wireless battery operated camera this one truly is the top of the field for price, picture, and ease of use.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UDS5FTNASJDD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086YK22DL","B086YK22DL","Size: One Pack"
"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020","Michael JC","-","-","Exporting recordings is convoluted, app is not intuitive, motion detection is slow to record","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.                         I’m using this as a trail camera because I’ve got a spot where a lot of animals like to move through, and I wanted to capture that for later viewing. I already have several IP cameras for security purposes, but I keep them inside due to various constraints such as wires and concerns about someone tampering with them. With this camera and a similar one I already had, I can set them up virtually anywhere so long as I can get a wifi signal to them. With them having an internal battery and needing occasional charging, I don’t really want to put them somewhere inaccessible, but they are somewhat small and inconspicuous, and it’s easy enough to hide them in things, especially as I don’t need to worry about solar charging.This camera is limited in that there is no zoom, pan, or tilt. In addition, you can’t control it via a web page by plugging in the IP address. You need to go through the app to use them. You can’t do ONVIF with it either and control it with another program.The initial set-up is pretty easy and takes just a few minutes. You do need to have your phone on the same 2.4ghz wifi network to access the camera, and while there is an option to get a paid cloud service for storing photos and videos with this app, you can also have the data saved to a micro sd card. There is mounting hardware included, and I find that what is here is decent, probably better than what was included with a similar camera that I have.As far as the image quality goes, it’s not bad. It’s not the greatest in the world, but it takes good enough pictures and videos for its purpose. The quality seems to be fairly standard for IP cameras at 1080p. It also has the ability to do alarms, and it has a speaker for 2-way communication. I haven’t tried either of those as I don’t need those functions, but they’re there. I did notice, with the motion detection, that the videos are a bit slow to capture the motion. There is a picture alert, but the recorded video is missing the first couple seconds of activity, which is a shame as I’ve definitely missed some important activity, though it may be less of an issue depending on how far away a target has to be to trigger the alert.The battery life is a bit tough to determine. I don’t know what settings drain the battery more or less slowly, so I don’t know if my settings are causing the battery to drain particularly quickly, but after 3.5 days, the battery had already gone from 100% to 60%, though after another couple of days, it went down to 55%, so I’m not sure if the app accurately shows how the battery is draining. With a similar camera, which seems like it has similar settings, I’ve had it running continuously use for 23 days, and it’s battery level is at 45%.The biggest knock on this camera, by far, is the app. Even though there are limited things to mess around with, it’s not intuitive at all. In order to access much of what you can do, you have to click on the live view, and there you can access alert history, which has an odd interface, and if you go up at the top, there are 3 dots. Clicking on them allows you to access most of the settings for the camera. Unfortunately, there is no explanation for what these settings do or how to best make use of the features, so you’re left to yourself to explore and figure it out the best you can. The whole alert/alarm thing in there is a bit confusing. Also, there is no clear way to export the recordings to your phone or any other device, which seems like a pretty important feature. The app for my other camera has both a share feature and a download feature right there under each video. In case you are wondering, what does seem to work is to play a video and hit the record button, which seems to save the portion you manually recorded to your phone. You can also pause the video and capture an image. That is not even remotely intuitive, but that is the only way I’ve been able to take any of what was recorded to the SD card and export it through the app. You might be able to pull out the SD card and download the recordings, but it’s much better to be able to do it through the app. On the plus side, the live view and the viewing of the recordings works well, and the wifi signal seems to be a little better with this camera.Overall, I think this is a decent camera, and once you figure out the quirks, it seems to work well. I’m happy to have it, but I would like to see a better user interface with the app and better features for exporting the recordings. Though perhaps it is intentionally difficult to export so as to induce you to sign up for their cloud software.","3","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615+VDi610L.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R6HRkkWXL.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nXgt8fg1L.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qlSmfskbL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RAPSqYgSS.mp4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MXQEPEYFW5S7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086YK22DL","B086YK22DL","Size: One Pack"

There is no way to delete a video from the app, which is ridiculous.- You can't SAVE a recorded video to your phone by just one simple click is outrageous; you have to actually manually hit record while the footage is playing back and stop to save that on your phone... having to do that on several footage is time consuming and terrible design.- Worst mount ever (I had to swap it with a different camera mount because the one included seriously stinks; you can't screw the camera tightly without the orientation to align the way you want - that's a really bad design.); a magnet-ball design would have been so much easier.- There's like 4 second delay when viewing with Amazon Echo- NO siren burglar alarm- NO built-in light- Videos saves as .data files (which I was able to view on Media Player Classic, but it won't let you fast foward/rewind)- Can't fast foward or seek while you're viewing full screen on the app (you have to scroll while you're minimized in the main timeline window)- Night Vision eats up battery (I turned it off)- Hate how you have to select ""Settings"" > ""Basic Function"" > ""Power management"" just to see the ACTUAL battery percentage... sooo inconvenient when it should give you an option to display the percentage on the main screen.It's a shame the app has to make so many things super inconvenient for the user when this camera has potential.","3","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616s0aXch-L.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q-bwgnEIL.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZIHbKkuJL.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oJK7lMPLL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H8853H72AD68/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086YK22DL","B086YK22DL","Size: One Pack"

Will look for a better quality unit.","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UMLE5426B97H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086YK22DL","B07WTK627L","Size: One Pack with SD Card"
"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020","Amazon Customer","yes","yes","Not to bad for first time cameras but compared to other I've seen theirs are alot better quality","There not bad cameras however when it detects someone or something it will start to record then it will stop whenever it wants to. I want it to keep recording until the person or whatever is out of sight. Also I have mine pointed at my driveway and the road and I'm lucky if it records the roads. Sometimes it will and sometimes it wont.","4","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WEENFW9QUC6E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086YK22DL","B07WTK627L","Size: One Pack with SD Card"
