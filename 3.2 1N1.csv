Video quality is good and motion detection is on point.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2020","Jiaying Zhou","yes","yes","Highly recommended","We recently bought one of these and when it arrived the set up guide was easy to use. I just downloaded the app, plugged in the camera, and followed the steps after hitting the setup button. Now for the camera - the picture is crystal clear, and I like that when I'm viewing my property through the app. The other great features include camera snapshot, recording on the spot, and a speaker to talk through the camera to whoever is being recorded or near the camera. I see this being the PERFECT device to be used indoors. It's less effective when used through windows but mostly does the job for me.","5","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616NSLIYwXL.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NhP9JapcL.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PYRJI1fpL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIFRWBBHONJUO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086VJN8RC","B086VJN8RC","Size: 1-Pack with 32G SD"

It was my first security camera and it took me less than 2 minutes to set up following the clear instructions! Once setting up, I could view live images from my phone with clear image. I tested it with a few hand waves and voila – I received instantaneous warnings on my phone. It also comes with a 3-month FREE storage service. While I am saving my videos locally, I do think that’s a great option to have. One more thing, the camera is attached to a ball-and-socket joint so it could really be rotated to suit my need. Really pleasant to use!","5","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61E1xnEf-fL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HOJ9Y9VHIUUP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086VJN8RC","-","-"

It is really amazing that something this affordable can be good. I have been using this for about a week now and I must repeat myself, I am impressed, so much so, I ordered a second that arrived yesterday. (The second one I ordered with and SD card when bundled, it is a really inexpensive SD card.)There are a few items during setup that are not as smooth as I would have hoped it would, but feel with time they will get the directions better. If this were a $100 camera, I would have given it only 4 stars, but this is a twenty-something $ camera and for this small investment, I still give it a 5.I will update this 5-star review in 6 months and let you know if my initial impression holds.

Sadly both of these options are terrible. The speaker volume is way too low, they have to be a foot from the camera to hear clearly. The motion detection is good but the alert is terrible on the phone app, which is basically a useless alert. You can't change the notification alert so the alert is basically the generic alert so if you get a text or motion alert, they don't make a difference.","3","-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CCPM18OQI1IG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B086VJN8RC","-","-"

So this is a revised review. Camera is very easy to set up over wifi, the picture is clear, sound good for the price. Since I installed it,  some of my phone apps stall even though I deleted 3 apps to make more room. Just have to close and reopen them.
